# CS457_Game
# Quiz Game

This is a simple Quiz game implemented using Python and sockets.

**How to play:**
1. **Start the server:** Run the `server.py` script by calling the file and using host and post for your parameters. E.G.("server 0.0.0.0 12345").
2. **Connect clients:** Enter the host and port used on a webbrowser of format("http://host:port")
3. **Starting the game:** Before a game can be played you must start the game using the start game button
4. **Play the game:** Players take turns entering their moves. The player with most correct answers wins!

**Technologies used:**
* Python
* Sockets
* HTTP

* Each sprint so like Sprint 1: server and client.
  
Task Breakdown:
* Task breakdown is loose and will tackle them as they come
  
Technical Requirements:

Hardware:
* No hardware requirements
  
Software:
* Python and sockets
  
Assumptions:
* Will assume that network is safe and can handle communication
  
Roles and Responsibilities:

Communication Plan:
* All communication is within my skull walls
  
Additional Notes:
* Hope you enjoy!


## Road Map
First Epic: First and foremost the most important thing is to go back and refactor and clean the code, make sure everything works as intended

Second Epic: This epic would entail encryption to ensure messages are encrypted during transmission.

Later will come adding more features, more interactive gameplay, and a way to keep score more accurately and give more points to players who answer first.

## Retrospective
**What went well**

The server and client architecture went well and having multiple classes helped keep the code clean and less confusing. I went back to fix and clean up the initial mess as it had gotten too convoluted too quickly. Adding the webserver functionality went surprisingly smoothly.

**What could be improved on**

I should improve my scope as my original scope was too large. This was quite costly as we were far into the semester and I had to reduce the scope significantly. I also should work on developing cleaner code with comments. This will allow for projects to be more scalable and easier to maintain as this was the main issue I ran into. The code was quite messy and it was unclear what did what making it hard to build upon the existing code.
